# NuGets

I mostly did it to avoid having to patch each of my libraries on all the projects that share them, they may not be perfect yet but i keep working on them...

I have no template for issues or anything, if you find any errors just open an issue (the more specific you are about the error the easiest for me to fix it), i'll try to check it as soon as i can.

If you find any of this stuff usefull i'ld like to know

To whoever is reading this => Have a nice day!!
